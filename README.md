# Inbound-Tourism-Revenue-influence-on-GDP--analysis

## Quest Overview üñç

Welcome to my analysis on how the inbound tourism revenue influences the GDP of countries around the world!

This project was developed while attending Ironhack's Data Analytics course, focusing on enhancing data visualization, Python skills, and gaining insights through exploratory data analysis techniques. It emphasizes structured approaches to handling and analyzing clean datasets.

## The Dataset üóÉ

The dataset analyzed in this project is a clean version provided as a .csv file https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhatvikas/world-tourism-economic-data , which was processed and loaded for analysis. 

It includes several key features related to the study‚Äôs objective:

Numerical and categorical variables: Analyzed using EDA techniques.

Formatted data: All numerical values are displayed with consistent formatting (two decimal places).

## Quest Development ‚öô

The flowchart below outlines my methodology for structuring and achieving the project‚Äôs objectives:

#### Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Handling Nan, empty spaces and duplicates

Format data accordingly for a better analysis

Create a .py file with the cleaning process (test_clean.csv)

Imported a clean dataset (test_clean.csv)

Formatted numerical values for consistency

Ignored warnings for a cleaner workspace

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Performed visual exploration of numerical and categorical variables using matplotlib and seaborn

Hypothesis Testing and correlations

#### Machine learning Classification:

LinearRegression model to predict if a gdp is considered high or low

Dealing with imbalanced data for better model preformance

RandomForestClassifier model for better metrics

#### Insights and Reporting:

Identified trends and patterns within the dataset.


## Data Visualizations üìä

After applying data cleaning techniques, the project generated insightful visualizations to summarize findings effectively. These were created using Python libraries and provide clarity on key features of the data. Examples include:

Scatter plots and heatmaps to identify correlations.

Histograms and box plots to observe distributions and outliers.

Additionally, visualizations were created on Tableau https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/in.s.bettencourt/viz/GDPvsTourismInboundAnalysisStory/Story?publish=yes & https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/in.s.bettencourt/viz/GDPvsTourismInboundAnalysisDashboard/Dashboard?publish=yes, offering interactive dashboards to complement the Jupyter Notebook outputs. These provide an enhanced exploration of the data and its features.

## Presentation üéÆ

A visual and interactive summary of the project is presented via Jupyter Notebook and Canva https://www.canva.com/design/DAGY7hKxYls/yV1xW-itEtFhfpyPvtHpVQ/edit?ui=eyJIIjp7IkEiOnRydWV9fQ. The Canva presentation includes:

Key insights and conclusions drawn from the analysis.

Visual storytelling to effectively communicate the findings.
