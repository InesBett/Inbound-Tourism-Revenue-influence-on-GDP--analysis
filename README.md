# Inbound Tourism Revenue influence on GDP |Analysis üåç‚úàÔ∏è

## Quest Overview 

Welcome to my analysis on how the inbound tourism revenue influences the GDP of countries around the world!

This project was developed while attending Ironhack's Data Analytics course, focusing on enhancing data visualization, Python skills, and gaining insights through exploratory data analysis techniques. It emphasizes structured approaches to handling and analyzing clean datasets.

## The Dataset üóÉ

The dataset analyzed in this project is a clean version provided as a [.csv file](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhatvikas/world-tourism-economic-data), which was processed and loaded for analysis. 

The provided dataset comprises 10 years of data (from 2000 to 2012) of World tourism economic data worldwide. It features 28 different columns, providing a comprehensive overview of the economic impact of tourism on countries:

**Birth Rate**: The number of live births per 1,000 people in a country.

**Business Tax Rate**: The percentage of total tax imposed on businesses.

**CO2 Emissions**: Total carbon dioxide emissions in metric tons per capita.

**Country**: The name of the country being analyzed.

**Days to Start Business**: Average number of days required to start a business in the country.

**Ease of Business**: An index measuring how conducive the regulatory environment is for business operations.

**Energy Usage**: Total energy consumption in kilowatt-hours per capita.

**GDP**: Gross Domestic Product of the country in USD.

**Health Exp % GDP**: Percentage of GDP allocated to healthcare expenditure.

**Health Exp/Capita**: Total healthcare expenditure per capita in USD.

**Hours to do Tax**: Average number of hours required to comply with tax regulations.

**Infant Mortality Rate**: The number of deaths of infants under one year old per 1,000 live births.

**Internet Usage**: Percentage of the population using the internet.

**Lending Interest**: Average lending interest rate in the country.

**Life Expectancy Female**: Average life expectancy for females in years.

**Life Expectancy Male**: Average life expectancy for males in years.

**Mobile Phone Usage**: Number of mobile phone subscriptions per 100 people.

**Number of Records**: The total number of records in the dataset.

**Population 0-14**: Population aged 0-14 years.

**Population 15-64**: Population aged 15-64 years.

**Population 65+**: Population aged 65 years and older.

**Population Total**: Total population of the country.

**Population Urban**: Percentage of the population living in urban areas.

**Region**: Geographic region where the country is located.

**Tourism Inbound**: Total revenue generated from international tourists visiting the country (in USD).

**Tourism Outbound**: Total expenditure by the country‚Äôs residents traveling abroad (in USD).

**Year**: Year of observation.

## Data Visualizations üìä

After applying data cleaning techniques, the project generated insightful visualizations to summarize findings effectively. These were created using Python libraries and provide clarity on key features of the data. Examples include:

*Scatter plots and heatmaps* to identify correlations.

*Histograms and box plots* to observe distributions and outliers.

Additionally, visualizations were created on [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/in.s.bettencourt/viz/GDPvsTourismInboundAnalysisDashboard/Dashboard?publish=yes), offering interactive dashboards to complement the Jupyter Notebook outputs. These provide an enhanced exploration of the data and its features.
